# Learning Object Model

An implied requirement of today is to provide mechanisms that store, manage and discover resources in an efficient way. This becomes a necessity for all kinds of digital resources, the number of which is increasing at an extremely rapid rate. Digital repositories are mechanisms that fulfill this requirement, provided that they utilize appropriate metadata schemata for the characterization of their content. Although generic metadata specifications (such as Dublin Core) seem to fulfill the need for documenting digital objects in general, educational resources demand a more specialized treatment and characterization.

A learning object, as per IEEE, is "any entity, digital or non-digital, that may be used for learning, education or training". This repository has a collection of specifications to provide a comprehensive suite of e-learning capabilities that enable interoperability, accessibility and reusability of digital learning objects. 

These specifications are designed to help achieve:

- Creation of well structured descriptions of learning objects. These descriptions will help facilitate the discovery, location, evaluation and acquisition of learning objects by students, teachers or learning systems. 
- Sharing of learning objects between learning systems. This will lead to a reduction in the cost of providing services based on high quality descriptions.
- Tailoring of the descriptions to suit the specialised needs of a community. This may include choosing suitable controlled vocabularies for pedagogy classification, reducing the number of elements that are described or adding new ones from other resource description schemas.
