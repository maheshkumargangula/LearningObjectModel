# Content Model



## Metadata Categories

Content metadata comprises a hierarchy of elements (as shown in below figure). At the first level there are eight categories, each of which contains sub-elements; these sub-elements may be simple elements that hold data, or may themselves be aggregate elements, which contain further sub-elements.
