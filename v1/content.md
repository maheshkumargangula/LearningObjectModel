# Content Model



## Metadata Categories

Content metadata comprises a hierarchy of elements (as shown in below figure). At the first level there are eight categories, each of which contains sub-elements; these sub-elements may be simple elements that hold data, or may themselves be aggregate elements, which contain further sub-elements. For example: "organisation framework" has sub-elements like board, medium, gradeLevel, etc.

Some of the elements may be repeated either individually or as a group. For example: there can be multiple "attributions" where each attribution is one value (string) and there can be multiple "target frameworks" where each target framework is a group of values (for board, medium, gradeLevel, etc).
